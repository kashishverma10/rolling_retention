####1. To create Rolling Retention Table :

SELECT 
  DISTINCT joining_day as day, 
  COUNT(player_id) OVER (PARTITION BY joining_day) players_joined, 
  SUM(retained) OVER (PARTITION BY joining_day) AS players_retained, 
  SUM(retained) OVER (PARTITION BY joining_day) / COUNT(player_id) OVER (PARTITION BY joining_day) fractional_retention 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      days_info.joining_day, 
      days_info.player_id as player_id, 
      CASE WHEN days_info.lastplay_day - days_info.joining_day > 30 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS retained 
    FROM 
      (
        SELECT 
          players.player_id, 
          players.joined as joining_day, 
          lastplay.lastplay_day 
        FROM 
          `junobigqueryclass.game_data.player_info` players 
          JOIN (
            SELECT 
              player_id as player_lastday, 
              MAX(day) as lastplay_day 
            FROM 
              `junobigqueryclass.game_data.matches_info` 
            GROUP BY 
              1
          ) as lastplay ON players.player_id = lastplay.player_lastday
      ) as days_info
  ) 
ORDER BY 
  1

####2. Do players with rolling 30-day retention spend more? Answer query :

SELECT 
  player_status, 
  SUM(amount_spent) as total_spent 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      * 
    FROM 
      (
        SELECT 
          player_id as pid, 
          SUM(price) as amount_spent 
        FROM 
          `junobigqueryclass.game_data.item_info` i 
          JOIN `junobigqueryclass.game_data.purchase_info` p ON i.item_id = p.item_id 
        GROUP BY 
          1
      ) AS player_spent 
      JOIN (
        SELECT 
          days_info.player_id as player_id, 
          CASE WHEN days_info.lastplay_day - days_info.joining_day > 30 THEN "retained" ELSE 'unretained' END AS player_status 
        FROM 
          (
            SELECT 
              players.player_id, 
              players.joined as joining_day, 
              lastplay.lastplay_day 
            FROM 
              `junobigqueryclass.game_data.player_info` players 
              JOIN (
                SELECT 
                  player_id as player_lastday, 
                  MAX(day) as lastplay_day 
                FROM 
                  `junobigqueryclass.game_data.matches_info` 
                GROUP BY 
                  1
              ) as lastplay ON players.player_id = lastplay.player_lastday
          ) as days_info
      ) as player_status ON player_status.player_id = player_spent.pid
  ) as table1 
GROUP BY 
  1 
ORDER BY 
  2 DESC


####3. Do players with 30-day rolling retention tend to be from a certain location? Answer Query:

SELECT 
  location, 
  COUNT(player_id) as total_retained_players 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      days_info.joining_day, 
      days_info.player_id as pid 
    FROM 
      (
        SELECT 
          players.player_id, 
          players.joined as joining_day, 
          lastplay.lastplay_day 
        FROM 
          `junobigqueryclass.game_data.player_info` players 
          JOIN (
            SELECT 
              player_id as player_lastday, 
              MAX(day) as lastplay_day 
            FROM 
              `junobigqueryclass.game_data.matches_info` 
            GROUP BY 
              1
          ) as lastplay ON players.player_id = lastplay.player_lastday
      ) as days_info 
    WHERE 
      days_info.lastplay_day - days_info.joining_day > 30
  ) AS r_info 
  JOIN `junobigqueryclass.game_data.player_info` as p_info ON p_info.player_id = r_info.pid 
GROUP BY 
  1 
ORDER BY 
  2 DESC
